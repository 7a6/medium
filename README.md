##rhizome


A modern course management system built on Spring, Couchbase, and Neo4J.

rhizome provides a portable and scaleable solution for building course management systems. A key aspect of rhizome is its infrastructural support for online conversations. Instead of a model in which each course has its own website, rhizome shifts the focus to students and their conversations with other students and their instructors. rhizome is built to extend the classroom conversations into an academic network, in all senses of the word.

rhizome works differently than traditional course management systems such as Moodle or Blackboard. These systems make one-size-fits-all course websites with limited configurability. rhizome dispenses with courses and instead connects students to students, emphasizing social relationships while still making it possible to communicate directly and privately with classmates about class business. 

rhizome is based on theories of social systems which, it turns out, translate into the programming world very well. 

###Requirements


At the very least, you will need Spring, Hibernate, Neo4J and a copy of rhizome. We use the latest versions of these tools.

###Building rhizome


rhizome uses a Maven-based build system.
